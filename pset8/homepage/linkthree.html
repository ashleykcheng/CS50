    			<h1>Rubik's Cube History</h1>
    			<p>
                The Rubik’s Cube was invented by a guy named Erno Rubik in 1974. He originally called it the “magic cube”. Erno Rubik invented the magic cube to explain three dimensional movement to his students while he was teaching at the Academy of Applied Arts in Budapest. Even though he invented the magic cube, it took Erno Rubik about over a month to learn how to solve it.He said, “It was a code I myself had invented! Yet I could not read it.”
                The Rubik’s Cube soon became a very popular toy. In 1975 Erno Rubik obtained the patent for the “magic cube”. In 1977 it was released in toy shops for the first time, and in 1979 he even got a worldwide distribution deal. The Rubik’s Cube was so popular that in 1980 and 1981 it received UK Toy of the Year award, even though most kids couldn’t solve it and peeled off the stickers. In 1981, 100 million Rubik’s Cubes were sold. The year after that, the First Rubik’s Cube World Championship was held. People from all over the world competed to see who could solve the cube the fastest. In 2003, the World Cube Association was founded by Ron Van Bruchem and Tyson Mao.
